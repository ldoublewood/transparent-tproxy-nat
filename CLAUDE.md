## What this project does

A nftables-based transparent proxy NAT gateway. It uses TPROXY to intercept TCP/UDP traffic from LAN clients and redirect it to a local proxy (ipt2socks, Xray, Clash, etc.), while also providing full NAT gateway forwarding + MASQUERADE for other traffic (ICMP, etc.).

## Key architectural concepts

**Two-path data flow:**

1. **TCP/UDP traffic → TPROXY → local proxy:** Packets entering the LAN interface are intercepted in the `prerouting mangle` chain via `tproxy ip to :<PORT>`, marked with a fwmark, then delivered to the local socket stack via policy routing (`fwmark 1 → table 100 → route 0.0.0.0/0 dev lo`). The proxy receives them with `SO_ORIGINAL_DST` preserving the real destination, processes them, and makes new outbound connections.

2. **Everything else → plain forwarding + MASQUERADE:** Non-TPROXY traffic (ICMP, etc.) passes through the `forward` chain and gets SNAT'd on the WAN interface via `masquerade` in the `postrouting` chain.

**Five nftables chains in a single `inet nat_gateway` table:**

| Chain | Hook / Priority | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `tproxy_prerouting` | prerouting / mangle | Intercept TCP/UDP → TPROXY; skip LAN/local/multicast traffic |
| `input` | input / filter | Drop by default; allow SSH, ICMP, DHCP, and TPROXY-marked packets |
| `forward` | forward / filter | Allow LAN→WAN forwarding, and TPROXY spoofed reply path (lo→LAN) |
| `output` | output / filter | Accept all (host is trusted) |
| `postrouting` | postrouting / srcnat | MASQUERADE on WAN interface for forwarded traffic |

**Critical kernel parameters** (set by `setup-tproxy-route.sh`):
- `ip_forward=1` — required for gateway operation
- `rp_filter=0` — **must** be off; TPROXY reply packets have spoofed source addresses that would be dropped
- `accept_local=1` — allows receiving packets with source addresses not in the interface's subnet
- `route_localnet=1` — allows routing to 127.0.0.0/8
- `lo.forwarding=1` and `<LAN_IFACE>.forwarding=1` — hairpin forwarding

## Common commands

**Deploy the full stack (must run as root):**
```bash
# 1. Policy routing + kernel params (must run BEFORE nftables)
sudo bash setup-tproxy-route.sh [fwmark] [rt_table] [iface] [lan_subnet]

# 2. Load nftables rules
sudo nft -f nftables-tproxy.conf

# 3. Persist for reboots
sudo cp nftables-tproxy.conf /etc/nftables.conf && sudo systemctl enable --now nftables
sudo cp setup-tproxy-route.sh /usr/local/bin/ && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/setup-tproxy-route.sh
sudo cp tproxy-route.service /etc/systemd/system/ && sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable --now tproxy-route
```

**Verification / debugging:**
```bash
sudo nft list ruleset                    # View all rules and counters
sudo nft list chain inet nat_gateway tproxy_prerouting  # Check TPROXY rule hit counts
sudo nft list chain inet nat_gateway input | grep mark  # Confirm TPROXY-marked packets accepted
sudo nft list chain inet nat_gateway forward | grep counter  # Check for drops
sudo journalctl -k -f | grep nft         # Live nftables log monitor
sudo tcpdump -i <LAN_IFACE> -n 'not host <gateway-ip>'  # Client traffic on LAN
sudo tcpdump -i <WAN_IFACE> -n           # Outbound WAN traffic
ip -4 rule show | grep fwmark            # Verify policy routing
ip route show table 100                  # Verify fwmark routing table
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward               # Must be 1
sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter       # Must be 0
ss -tlnp | grep 17893                    # Proxy must listen on 0.0.0.0:17893
```

**Cleanup:**
```bash
sudo nft flush ruleset                    # Remove all nftables rules
ip -4 rule del fwmark 1 table 100         # Remove policy routing rule
ip -4 route del local 0.0.0.0/0 dev lo table 100  # Remove route table entry
```

## Critical pitfalls

1. **Proxy MUST listen on `0.0.0.0`, NOT `127.0.0.1`.** TPROXY delivers packets with their original destination address (e.g., `1.2.3.4:443`). A socket bound to `127.0.0.1` won't match these packets, and the kernel will RST the connection.

2. **`rp_filter` MUST be `0`.** TPROXY reply packets have the external server's IP as the source (spoofed). With reverse-path filtering enabled, the kernel drops them because the source IP isn't reachable via the LAN interface.

3. **`setup-tproxy-route.sh` MUST run BEFORE nftables rules are loaded.** The policy routing table must exist before the first TPROXY-marked packet arrives; otherwise those packets fall through to normal routing and bypass the proxy.

4. **Single-interface (hairpin) mode:** When both `LAN_IFACE` and `WAN_IFACE` are set to the same interface, `lo.forwarding` and `<iface>.forwarding` must both be on, and the forward chain must accept `iif "lo" oif $LAN_IFACE` for TPROXY spoofed replies to reach clients.

## File roles

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `nftables-tproxy.conf` | The nftables ruleset — single source of truth for all filtering/NAT |
| `setup-tproxy-route.sh` | One-shot script for policy routing + kernel parameters; idempotent (cleans old rules first) |
| `tproxy-route.service` | systemd oneshot service wrapping the script for persistence across reboots |
